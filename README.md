For my current school, full-stack dev projects, see the Yoann-B-ENI GitHub profile above. (Java Spring, PHP Symfony, Angular, Kotlin, Flutter, NodeJS). 
In this GitHub, my personal projects on Data Science & Computer Vision. 

For my short paper/article on the use of ColabFold for PepPI prediction, see [this repo](https://github.com/yoann-ba/ColabFold_PepPI_files)

## WIP or planned projects
- OpenGL (PyOpenGL probably first) graphics renderer
- ML automatic text display speed learner

## Paused projects
- catching up on neurips 2023 and other confs, adding other older paper summaries
- spikeball ball tracking AI (on video)

## Idea backlog
- Cel shader that just casts to a flag
- Online pillbox app
- Dynamic polygon image process but applied to 3d models
- Sound environment ambience analysis
- 
- comparison of softmax vs. self-learned estimate of performance (i.e generalising AlphaFold 2's plddt principle to all models)
- Antartica/Greenland ice-free terrain maps in UE
- re-do a simple pixel-value satellite img segmenter?
- something with dither (for images)? make the amogus dithering actual global dithering?
- explore matching sounds/look at differences/distances between sound bits?
- mix of procedural generation and an ML model to explore the space of parameters of the procedural gen
- automatic color palette stuff, comparing baseline general color theory vs. ML model made on subjective taste (also as a shader or game stylizing?)

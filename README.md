Current projects :
- finishing a paper on ColabFold PepPI (paper + repo)
- video on it afterwards

Past projects to re-upload/re-format : 
- make videos + a repo on terrain simulation (perlin noise explanation/example, past work on erosion, integration into Unity/UE)
- make video on intro to AI/Data Science (for someone outside of the field, overview of major paradigms, the evolution until today and why they may have heard of certain models at certain times)
- video on biology basics for non-biology Data Scientist
- make video + repo on satellite data, sentinelhub example (UE terrain integration example?)
- make video on past Unity AI sims (genetic algo)
- make video on past game dev projects? (all Unity/UE game stuff?)
- make repo for my general utils/tips files/memos
- make video (+code) on overview/explanation of color spaces (for Data Science)

Future projects to make : 
- comparison of softmax vs. self-learned estimate of performance (i.e generalising AlphaFold 2's plddt principle to all models)
- Antartica/Greenland ice-free terrain maps in UE
- re-do a simple pixel-value satellite img segmenter?
- something with dither (for images)?
- re-make a hillshade map algorithm
- explore matching sounds/look at differences/distances between sound bits?

Done : 
- video on quick speedrun of simulating the "Painting by Numbers" process (see YT + short projects repo)

New GitHub profile where I'm just recently uploading current and past works, still a WIP to re-document old things properly.

Current projects :
- catching up on neurips 2023 and other confs, adding other older paper summaries
- make videos + a repo on terrain simulation (perlin noise explanation/example, past work on erosion simulation, integration into Unity/UE, minecraft-style maps)

----

Past projects to re-upload/re-format : 
- make video on biology basics for non-biology Data Scientist
- make video on past Unity AI sims (genetic algo)
- make video on past game dev projects? (all Unity/UE game stuff?)
- make video (+code) on overview/explanation of color spaces (for Data Science)?

Future projects to make : 
- comparison of softmax vs. self-learned estimate of performance (i.e generalising AlphaFold 2's plddt principle to all models)
- Antartica/Greenland ice-free terrain maps in UE
- re-do a simple pixel-value satellite img segmenter?
- something with dither (for images)? make the amogus dithering actual global dithering?
- re-make a hillshade map algorithm
- explore matching sounds/look at differences/distances between sound bits?
- mix of procedural generation and an ML model to explore the space of parameters of the procedural gen
- automatic color palette stuff, comparing baseline general color theory vs. ML model made on subjective taste (also as a shader or game stylizing?)

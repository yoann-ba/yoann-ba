GitHub profile where I'm just recently uploading current and past personal works, still a WIP to re-document old things properly. Haven't yet added my current fullstack dev school projects.

For my short paper/article on the use of ColabFold for PepPI prediction, see [this repo](https://github.com/yoann-ba/ColabFold_PepPI_files)

Current projects (on hold) :
- catching up on neurips 2023 and other confs, adding other older paper summaries
- make videos + a repo on terrain simulation (perlin noise explanation/example, past work on erosion simulation, integration into Unity/UE, minecraft-style maps)
- spikeball ball tracking AI (on video)

----

Future projects : 
- comparison of softmax vs. self-learned estimate of performance (i.e generalising AlphaFold 2's plddt principle to all models)
- Antartica/Greenland ice-free terrain maps in UE
- re-do a simple pixel-value satellite img segmenter?
- something with dither (for images)? make the amogus dithering actual global dithering?
- explore matching sounds/look at differences/distances between sound bits?
- mix of procedural generation and an ML model to explore the space of parameters of the procedural gen
- automatic color palette stuff, comparing baseline general color theory vs. ML model made on subjective taste (also as a shader or game stylizing?)
- ML text display speed, simplest model for wide adoption (log reg?)
